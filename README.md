# Calendar_Mod_v1.0
Mod that allows you to add custom events to your Moni's calendar
How to install:
Just put the calendar.rpy file in the Submods folder. The path should look something like: ...\game\Submods\Calendar.rpy
Some tips:
1)In order to add the event to the calendar,you need to put the event name , event month and date in that order separated by comas. For example : I love Monika,4,3
2)Whatever you add should appear in the calendar immideatly .However when you delete something it dissapears only after you reload the game
3)The length of the event is fixed(around 35 letters). However you can easily change it in the code
To be improved:
1)In the game there is a built-in interface to work with calendar. This mode does not use it ,but it would be better if it did
2)It would be better if Monika could react to different events, or remind you of them.
3)It would be better if after deleting an event , it would go away from the calendar immideatly ,without a need to restart a game.
4)Some event specific reactions .For example , if the reaction name mentions "shopping" Monika would ask you to take her with you.
5)Do not hesitate to contact me. Any suggestion would be appreciated.
